System and Process Issues
High CPU Usage by a Process

Symptom: System is slow or unresponsive.
Troubleshooting:
Use top or htop to identify the process.
Use ps aux | grep <PID> for further details.
Investigate the process or restart it using systemctl restart <service>.

Out of Memory (OOM) Issue
Symptom: Processes are killed, system is unresponsive.
Troubleshooting:
Check memory usage: free -m.
Identify memory-hogging processes: top or ps aux --sort=-%mem.
Consider adding swap space or tuning application memory usage.

Service Fails to Start
Symptom: Service does not start or crashes after starting.
Troubleshooting:
Check service status: systemctl status <service>.
Inspect logs: journalctl -xe or /var/log/<service>.log.
Ensure configuration files are valid, then restart the service.

Disk Space Full
Symptom: Unable to write files, system errors.
Troubleshooting:
Check disk usage: df -h.
Identify large files: du -sh * | sort -rh | head.
Delete or archive unused files, or resize partitions.

Zombie Processes
Symptom: High load, but no active processes.
Troubleshooting:
Identify zombies: ps aux | grep 'Z'.
Find and restart the parent process to clean up the zombie.

Network-Related Issues
DNS Resolution Failure
Symptom: Unable to reach websites or services by hostname.
Troubleshooting:
Test DNS: nslookup <hostname> or dig <hostname>.
Check /etc/resolv.conf for valid DNS server entries.
Use alternative DNS like Google DNS (8.8.8.8) for testing.

Service Port Not Open
Symptom: Service is running, but inaccessible.
Troubleshooting:
Check if the service is listening on the port: ss -tuln | grep <port>.
Verify firewall rules (UFW or iptables).
Ensure service configuration allows connections from external networks.
Packet Loss / Network Latency

Symptom: Slow network or intermittent connectivity.
Troubleshooting:
Ping the server: ping <host>.
Trace the route: traceroute <host>.
Check network congestion or faulty hardware.

IP Conflict
Symptom: Two machines with the same IP address.
Troubleshooting:
Use arp -a to view MAC address mappings.
Identify conflicting devices and assign unique IPs.

Unable to Connect to Database
Symptom: Application cannot reach the database.
Troubleshooting:
Check database server status: systemctl status <db-service>.
Verify network access and firewall rules.
Ensure correct credentials and database URL in configuration files.
File System and Storage Issues
File Corruption

Symptom: Files cannot be read or are corrupted.
Troubleshooting:
Use fsck to check the filesystem integrity.
Restore corrupted files from a backup if available.
NFS Share Unmounted

Symptom: NFS share is not accessible.
Troubleshooting:
Check the mount status: mount | grep nfs.
Remount using: mount -a.
Ensure the NFS server is running and accessible.
Slow Disk I/O

Symptom: Slow read/write performance.
Troubleshooting:
Monitor I/O performance: iostat -x.
Check for I/O bottlenecks, such as high wait times.
Unable to Unmount a File System

Symptom: umount command fails.
Troubleshooting:
Find processes using the mount point: lsof | grep <mount-point>.
Kill the processes or move them off the mount point.
Logs and Monitoring Issues
Log File Growing Too Large

Symptom: Log file consumes excessive disk space.
Troubleshooting:
Rotate logs using logrotate.
Configure log retention policies to limit log size.
